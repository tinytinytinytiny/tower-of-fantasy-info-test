<p>
	Matrices (AKA Chips) are weapon attachments that provide stat boosts and special effects.
</p>
<p>
	There are 4 slots on each weapon: Emotion, Mind, Belief, and Memory. Each of these slots gives slightly different passive stats.
</p>
<p>
	Higher effect values can be unlocked by awakening (starring) all the chips used in the set.
