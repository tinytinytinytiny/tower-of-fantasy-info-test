### Dimensional Trials
#### **Up to 4-player dungeon** that rewards **Gold**
Dimensional trials are a source of gold and consist of up to 4 players running through an instance that rotates everyday. If the timer expires or all 4 players die the instance will close. Everyday there is a rotating buff that enemies within the instance can receive.

{% china %} Additional difficulties that give much more gold were added.

### Interstellar Exploration
#### **Up to 4-player dungeon** that rewards **Breakthrough Mats**
Portals go *brrr*. Everyday you will receive a varying amount of personal portals on your map. There are 3 tiers of portal which increase both the difficulty and reward (higher tier personal portals are level gated but can be accessed via party system).

Inside you will fight 3 waves of mobs with various weaknesses and strengths. As mentioned earlier you can use the recruitment tab to post your portal or access others if you wish to target farms in specific material. Once the 3 waves have been cleared there is a chance a boss will spawn for bonus rewards, so do wait for the leave timer to come up before exiting.

### Omnium Beacon
#### **Solo content** that rewards **Breakthrough Mats**
By spending energy players can obtain beacons of which can be placed around the world to accumulate energy. Once a certain period of time has passed they open and players will receive rewards in their mail. Beacons can be placed anywhere in the world as long as it is not covered by a “roof” so try to find creative places to hide them.

There is a chance every time you gain a beacon to receive a card which is used for a “hide and seek” mini game. By clicking on the card you will be able to see a green circle on the map, by travelling there and clicking the card again 3 images will be shown instead. Once you approach the area shown on the card you will see a glimmer similar in colour to your card which you can now use to unlock the cache.

The tiers of beacon/card from lowest to highest are: blue, purple and yellow, with the rewards scaling with the tier. The general loot pool is exp cards (chip and weapon) and weapon materials of any tier.

### Spacetime Domain
#### **Solo dungeon** that rewards selectable **Breakthrough Mats**
In Spacetime Domain you run through a random ruin but there are no chests present, your objective is just to clear within 20 minutes. Every stage ends with a boss fight, fights tend to be relatively easy as you have most likely fought them before. The rewards are weapon material crates and weapon exp cards along with a little exp. It is a solo activity so you will not be able to run it with other players.

## Other Dungeons
### Dream Machines
#### **Solo dungeons** that give random rewards such as **Relic Fragments, Armor Modules, and Gold and Black Cores**
Dreams are the orbs that have a chance of dropping in the overworld when opening chests/password boxes and defeating elite monsters. Up to 7 Dream Machines will drop every week.

### Ruins
#### **Solo dungeon** that rewards **EXP, gold, relic fragments, and more**
Unique overworld dungeons ranging from A-01 to E-03, each with 3 difficulties. The first few will give you Relics that you can then use in the overworld.

Ruins are unlocked by leveling up, and the first time doing a specific ruin will require you to enter from the overworld entrance, after which they can be quickly entered through the dungeon menu. Ruins can only be cleared one time, but can be re-entered at any time.

### Ability Training
#### **Solo minigames** that reward **Training Points**
4 daily minigames that are randomly selected from all of the options, such as matching cards, soccer, . As you unlock the map, more Ability Training stations will become available, and the later maps often give more Training Points too.

### Bygone Phantasm
#### **Solo dungeon** that rewards **Crystal Dust and Armor Modules**
Clear endless stages of enemies and compete with other players within your (randomly generated) ranking bracket. Random weapons are buffed, changing every 5 stages. Every 5th stage is a boss.

First time floor clear rewards include Dark Crystals. Weekly rewards are sent to your mailbox based on your ranking within the bracket.

At weekly reset, your current floor will be reset down to the closest multiple of ten, i.e. from 79 to 70. The enemies on each floor will also be changed at weekly reset.

{% china %} Some other modes were added within Bygone Phantasm, and doing all 3 will boost your total ranking score.


### Frontier Clash
#### **Up to 4-player dungeon** that rewards **Armor**
Clear 15 waves of enemies within the time limit (starts once you activate the lever). The run is also consumed once you activate the lever so don’t try to reset after starting. Every third wave is a single boss enemy—clear the boss within the timer to unlock a chest that will payout rewards at the end.

You will get 1 run on Tues/Thurs/Sat, and can hold up to 3 runs. Frontier Clash has dungeon-wide resistance effects on a random element each day. A damage boost buff is applied for every guild member in the party.

{% china %} Hard mode: 5 waves of only bosses.

### Void Rift
#### **Up to 4-player dungeon** that rewards **Matrices**
Defeat enemies in the first stage to collect buffs (blue pyramid icons) and keys (drops from Hellamanders). After 3 keys are obtained, you can challenge the boss.

Buffs have a set effect that can be activated upon obtaining 3 copies of that buff. Additionally, a team-wide buff is applied to everyone for each member that has activated a set effect. The buff menu in the bottom left is where you can transfer buffs, request buffs, and see how many are remaining.

The dungeon has 2 effects that randomize each day—they apply to both the players and the enemies.

### Wormhole
#### **Solo dungeon** that rewards **Crystal Dust**
An 8-stage solo dungeon where you collect buffs (blue pyramid icons) from enemies and fight bosses on stage 4 and 8. Various buffs can be obtained and have a set effect at 4 copies. Healing is greatly reduced—however it is still viable to heal up before boss stages.

Hunting stages will have some timer extenders and possibly buffs on the ground. Buffs are obtained from defeating elite monsters, each adding 25% stage completion. Regular mobs can drop a small heal and slightly charge stage completion. Note that clearing a stage kills all enemies on your screen—you can gather elites when at a high completion % and kill one to receive buffs from all of them.

Each Constellation (Lv 40, Lv 50, Lv 60 version) of Wormhole has 24 stages. Once you clear stage 8 (one lap), all buffs get reset and you start at stage 1 again (with harder enemies and a higher reward), up to 3 times (one circuit). Each Wormhole Constellation can only be cleared once. Every 4 days you will receive a reward amount in your mailbox based on how far you cleared the latest Constellation. Every 8 stages cleared will also give you a free box and a purchasable box in the shop with some useful items.

## Raids
### Raid 1
#### **Up to 8-player dungeon** that rewards **Arc Core armor piece & Raid Shop currency**
Fight against {{ characters.apophis.name }} in a room. There is no shield to break, just damage the boss without dying—it hits hard and can easily one-shot top geared players. Use the Omnium Handcannon relic to consistently block {{ characters.apophis.name }}’ spirit bomb attack.

There is a strategy where you use {{ characters.zero.name }}’s Discharge skill for invincibility with {{ getData(collections.relics, 'couant').name }}’s 5th awakening and {{ characters.barbarossa.name }} matrices to damage reflect the spirit bomb, but it requires you to stay alive and wait in the dungeon for 15 minutes for {{ characters.apophis.name }} to enrage (thus doing more damage). The attack’s damage was nerfed so you can’t one shot the boss with this.

### Raid 2
#### **Up to 8-player dungeon** that rewards **Arc Core armor piece & Raid Shop currency**
Fight {{ characters.frigg.name }} in one dimension and Valkyrie in another dimension. These bosses have to be killed within 30 seconds of each other to clear, otherwise they will reset to full HP.

As Valkyrie is the more dangerous option, it’s recommended to have all 8 players bring {{ characters.frigg.name }} down to about 50% HP on the last HP bar, then leave one person to kite her while the other 7 kill Valkyrie. {{ characters.frigg.name }} can easily be kited at a range where she will chase you around the map but cannot attack you.

### Raid 3
#### **Up to 8-player dungeon** that rewards **Arc Core armor piece & Raid Shop currency**
Defeat both copies of {{ characters.nemesis.name }}—red and yellow. The two bosses will heal each other if they are near each other, thus the recommended strategy is to rotate around the left side of the map and have one person use a bow charged shot to pull one boss into the left outer ring of the map. When successfully separated, the two bosses are relatively easy to defeat on their own. Killing the first boss will respawn any dead players.
