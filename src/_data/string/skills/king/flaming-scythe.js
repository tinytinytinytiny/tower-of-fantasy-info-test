	desc: 'When ***weapon charge is full*** or ***Phantasia*** is triggered, **remove all debuffs from the wielder** and create a Flaming Scythe upon switching to this weapon, dealing damage equal to **277%** of ATK + **15** and lasts for **10** seconds. Additionally, spawn Flaming Scythes every **2** seconds. The scythes summon volcanic eruptions from the ground, which deal damage equal to **60%** of ATK + **3** to targets and knock them into the air.'
