	desc: 'When ***weapon charge is full*** or ***Phantasia*** is triggered, **remove all debuffs from the wielder**, and smash the ground to form a barrier upon switching to this weapon, dealing damage equal to **419.3%** of ATK + **22** to nearby enemies, knocking enemies into the air. This reduces their speed by **50%** and stops them from dodge or jump. The barrier lasts **5** seconds and blocks projectiles.'
